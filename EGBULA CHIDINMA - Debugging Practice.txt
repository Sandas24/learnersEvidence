DEMO CLASS EXERCISE
Consider at the following code:
Def Cal_force(mass, g)
   knowing the mass and gravity you calculate the weight:
   Phy_force = mass * g;
   print(“%.2f kg of mass gives a weight of %.2f N” %(,phy_force))
Clearly, there several things wrong with it. Using your python expertise, fix this broken code to make
the program functional.
a.
 During the fixing process, record the bugs you encounter. Show how you fixed them.
b.
 You can use either python internal debugging tool to identify bugs or can do the process
manually.
c.
 Test the fixed program to see if it meets its primary purpose of calculating weights. Take
screenshots to demonstrate your procedure. Tips: use a testing range of 0 to 3 kg. For the
expected outputs, take g = 9.8 and 2.5
 
Error 1:
Syntax Error: invalid syntax
Possible cause: I did not define the function Cal_force properly. Python function requires a  semi colon (:)at the end of () thus the error.
Correction:
Def cal_force(mass,g):
Error 2:
Possible cause:
Phy_force= mass*g is the undefined.
Correction:
cal_force(mass*g) as a return statement.
 
Error 3:
Possible cause:
print(“%.2f kg of mass gives a weight of %.2f N” %(,phy_force))-conversion is different from the argument.(g),(Kg). function phy_force parsed is undefined
Correction:
print(“%.2f kg of mass gives a weight of %.2f” %(cal_force))
 


Def cal_force(mass,g):
 #  knowing the mass and gravity you calculate the weight:
   print(“%.2f of mass gives a weight of %.2f” %(cal_force)) 
cal_force(10 *9.8)
